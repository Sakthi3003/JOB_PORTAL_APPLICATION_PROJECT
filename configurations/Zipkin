<dependency>
  <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
  <artifactId>micrometer-tracing-bridge-brave</artifactId>
</dependency>
✅ What it does:
This dependency connects Spring Boot's Micrometer Tracing with Brave (a tracing library created by the Zipkin team).

🗂️ Think of it like:

“I collect trace data in Spring Boot ➡️ I want to send it using Brave ➡️ I need this bridge.”

Edit
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.zipkin.reporter2</groupId>
  <artifactId>zipkin-reporter-brave</artifactId>
</dependency>
✅ What it does:
This is the reporter that sends tracing data to Zipkin using Brave.

🗂️ Think of it like:

“Now that I have the trace data (with Brave), I need to report/send it to the Zipkin server.”

🔗 Together:
Dependency	Role
micrometer-tracing-bridge-brave	Connects Spring Boot’s Micrometer with Brave
zipkin-reporter-brave	Sends the trace data from Brave to Zipkin

🖼️ Real-world analogy:
You (Spring Boot app) want to track delivery (tracing):

🛠️ Micrometer builds tracking info

🧩 Brave packages it

📦 zipkin-reporter sends it to Zipkin server
