DISTRIBUTED TRACING

What is Distributed Tracing?
Distributed Tracing is a method used to track and observe the flow of a single request as it travels through multiple services or components in a distributed system (like microservices).

âœ… Key Points:
Helps you see the complete journey of a request

Shows which services were called, in what order

Identifies where delays or failures happen

Each step of the request is recorded as a span; all spans are linked by a trace ID



What is Zipkin?


Zipkin is an open-source Distributed Tracing System that helps collect, store, and visualize trace data.

âœ… What Zipkin does:
Receives trace data from your services

Displays request timelines

Shows which service took how long

Helps debug performance issues in microservices

ðŸ§© Zipkin + Spring Cloud Sleuth
Sleuth adds trace and span IDs to logs and headers

Zipkin collects and shows that trace data in a UI

ðŸ”— One-liner Definitions:
Distributed Tracing:

A method to trace the full path of a request across multiple microservices to monitor performance and pinpoint issues.

Zipkin:

A distributed tracing tool that collects and visualizes trace data from services to help developers understand request flows and troubleshoot issues.


Company microservice -> 
to Zipkin which has

Collector - collect all the traces
storate -> store all the data
search -> ui helps us to search
visualisation -> helps u to visualisation


trace is tree of work done based on the request journey of a request

 Span id show the indivual work like it denotes a microservice a new span Is created to represent the operation done by the microservice

Zipkin quickstart 
java jar download and place in in the project and run it 
java -jar "zipkin-server-3.5.1-exec.jar" filename


9411 port number to use zipkin

or stop and use zipkin docker 

docker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin


docker compose service commands
 zipkin:
    image: openzipkin/zipkin
    container_name: zipkin
    ports:
      - 9411:9411
    networks:
      - postgres
add them and run them makes things easier
